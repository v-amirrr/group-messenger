<br />
For loggin out as a guest you just need to click on the three-dots menu at the top left of the page then click on of the options.
<br />
In login with name mode the name you choose should be uniuqe and it shouldn't be used before by someone else. 
<br />
Remeber you can't logout or change the name YET.
<br />
<br />
After you logged in you easily send any message you want. To see message options you ust need to click on a message. Based on the message you'll see a bunch of options. If it's one of your messages you'll see reply, copy, edit and delete icon. If it's someone else's message you'll only see reply and copy icon and if you're in guest mode you'll just see copy icon.
<br />
